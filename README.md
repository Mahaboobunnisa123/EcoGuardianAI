> An innovative AI-powered system for real-time microplastic detection in aquatic environments using multi-modal machine learning that combines real EPA environmental sensor data with computer vision.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Microplastic pollution threatens marine ecosystems and human health, with over **8 million tons** of plastic entering oceans annually. Current detection methods are:
- ⏰ **Time-consuming** (manual microscopy takes hours)
- 💰 **Expensive** (specialized equipment required)
- 🔬 **Laboratory-bound** (no real-time field monitoring)
- 📊 **Single-modal** (limited analysis scope)

## 💡 Our Solution
EcoGuardian AI addresses these challenges through:

### 🤖 **Multi-Modal AI Architecture**
- **Environmental Sensor Analysis**: Random Forest processing water temperature, pH, turbidity, flow rate, and dissolved oxygen
- **Computer Vision System**: CNN-based particle detection and counting from water sample images
- **Data Fusion Engine**: Ensemble learning combining both modalities for enhanced accuracy

### 🚀 **Key Innovations**
1. **Real-time Detection**: Process data in seconds vs. hours
2. **Multi-Modal Approach**: Combines sensor + vision data for unprecedented accuracy
3. **Real EPA Data Integration**: Uses authentic government environmental monitoring data
4. **Edge Deployment Ready**: Lightweight models suitable for field deployment
5. **Intelligent Alerting**: Risk-based notification system with actionable insights
